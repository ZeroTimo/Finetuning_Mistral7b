# QLoRA Fine-tuning of Mistral-7B for Causal Language Modeling

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune the Mistral-7B language model using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA). QLoRA allows efficient fine-tuning of large language models on consumer hardware by quantizing the base model and training only a small set of adapter parameters.

## Introduction

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can be resource-intensive. QLoRA significantly reduces memory requirements and training time, making it feasible to fine-tune powerful models like Mistral-7B on machines with limited resources. This project provides a clear and concise example of how to perform QLoRA fine-tuning using the `transformers` and `peft` libraries.

## Key Features

* **QLoRA Fine-tuning:**  Uses 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters for efficient fine-tuning.
